Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Define Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures as they pertain to threat modeling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ What do we mean when we use the term 'TTP'?
  - The behavior of a threat actor
+ Why are we concerned with the behavior of an attacker?
  - Profiling
  - Threat modeling
+ Explain the concept of Tactics.
  - Tactics are initial objectives
    + I want to gather networking information about my target
    + I want to find out what services my target is running
    + I want to get all the email addresses I can
    + What vulnerabilities does my target have
+ So how does Techniques differ from Tactics?
  - Techniques are the ways I achieve my objective and tools used
    + Perform DNS queries using dig
    + Perform network scans and banner grabbing
    + Scrape the internet for email addresses with the target domain
    + Perform vulnerability scanning against my target
+ Where do Procedures fit into the equation?
  - Advanced action taken to achieve objectives
    + Threat actor profiles users on social media
    + Performs advanced application testing to discover zero-day exploits
    + Does advanced obfuscation techniques in malware payloads
