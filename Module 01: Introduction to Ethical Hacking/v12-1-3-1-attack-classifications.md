Attack Classifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- List and define the different attack classifications
- Associate specific attacks types with the attack classifications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Can we start off by listing Attack Classifications we'll need to be aware of?
  - Passive Attacks
  - Active Attacks
  - Close-In Attacks
  - Insider Attacks
  - Distribution Attacks
+ Let's dig into Passive Attacks
  - Gathering info by inspecting network traffic
    + Clear-text passwords
    + Other sensitive info (in the clear)
    + Difficult/impossible to detect
+ Any Passive Attack examples?
  - Packet Sniffing
  - Network traffic analysis
  - Decryption
+ How about Active Attacks? What are they and how do they differ from Passive?
  - Manipulation of data
  - Disruption of services
  - Breaking into systems and compromising networks
  - Can be detected
+ A few examples of Active Attacks?
  - DoS
  - Password Attacks
  - Session Hijacking
  - Priv Esc
  - SQLi
  - RCE
+ What are we talking about with regards to Close-in Attacks?
  - These attacks are possible through close proximity
    + Being physically near the target could provide opportunity to glean
      actionable intel
  - Could also be through any type of personal contact with target
+ What are some examples of Close-In Attacks?
  - Social engineering
  - Shoulder surfing
  - Dumpster Diving
  - Eavesdropping
+ I've heard that Insider Attacks can be very catastrophic. What do we mean by
  'Insider Attack' and why is it so dangerous?
  - Assumed level of trust
    + Physical access
    + Computer access
    + Attacker is already beyond many/all safeguards
+ Examples of Insider Attacks?
  - Intellectual Property
  - Customer PII
    + Pod Slurping
  - Stolen devices
  - Installing malware and keyloggers
  - Close-in Attacks
    + Social Engineering

+ Difficult but devastating, we have the Distribution Attack. What's this all
  about?
  + aka Supply-Chain Attack
  + Compromising software and/or hardware before customer installation
+ Examples of Distribution Attacks
  + Solarwinds
