Footprinting Concepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Define Footprinting and Footprinting types and describe its objectives in the
  attack process
- Explain types of information gathered during the Footprinting phase
- Explore Footprinting as a Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ What is Footprinting?
  - Passive
    + No direct interaction with target
      - Kind of like 'eavesdropping' on a conversation
      - Looking for freely available/public info
        + May get lucky and find unsecured sensitive info
    + Difficult/impossible to detect
  - Active
    + Direct interaction with target
      - Interrogation vs eavesdropping
    + Detection possible
+ What kinds of information are attackers looking for?
  - System Info
    + OS type
    + Services
    + Usernames/Passwords
  - Network Info
    + DNS
    + Domain/Sub-domains
    + Firewall rules
  - Organizational Info
    + Contact info
    + Employee info
    + Location info
+ How does this information help attackers?
  - May reveal security controls
  - Helps them focus on live targets
  - Vulnerability identification
+ So does Footprinting directly lead to target compromise?
  - Usually not directly, but it is a crucial step towards that end
  - It supports compromise attacks like
    + Social Engineering
    + Sensitive Data Exposure
    + System/Network Hacking
