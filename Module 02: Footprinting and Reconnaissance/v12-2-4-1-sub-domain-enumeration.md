Sub-Domain Enumeration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Search for a target's subdomains by utilizing common hacking tools to
  properly footprint their attack surface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ What is a sub-domain?
  - Domains
    + Main web presence
      - Domain name
        + aka 2nd Level Domain
      - gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domain)
        + Catch-all for specific areas
          - .com
          - .net
  - Sub-Domains
    + Secondary web presence
      - Used to organize web sites that are big enough to need their own space
        + Same idea as a Sub-directory in a file system

+ How do we do subdomain enumeration and why is it important to ethical hacking?
  - It's important because...
    + It's apart of the attack surface
  - We can find them a couple of ways
    + Manual searching (demo)
      - Google
        + site:itpro.tv
      - Page source code
+ That seems a bit tedious. Can we automate that process?
    + Automation (demo)
      - netcraft
      - sublist3r
