      - Categories
        + Service aggregation
          - The cloud broker combines and integrates multiple existing services
            into new service, carrying responsibility of data integration between
            cloud consumer and cloud providers.
        + Service intermediation
          - A cloud broker provides value-added service, enhancing an existing
            service by improving some of its capabilities.
        + Service arbitrage
          - This is similar to service aggregation but with flexible dynamic
            choice of service providers based on the brokerâ€™s internal evaluations.

+ Cloud Storage Architecture
  - Front-End
    + Where the end user interacts with the data through an API
  - Middleware
    + Data De-duplication and Replication
  - Back-End
    + Metal hardware
